        One fateful winter break, a few students involved with Association for
        Computer Science Undergraduates (ACSU) wanted to provide a resource that
        not only addresses a handful of frequently asked questions but also
        serves as a more comprehensive guide to the Computer Science major at
        Cornell University than what the Unofficial CS Wiki offered. We hope
        that this guide will (1) serve as one of the many useful resources that
        underclassmen can use to acclimate to Cornell University as a CS major
        or minor and (2) be further improved by experienced upperclassmen who
        have accumulated helpful perspectives being in Cornellâ€™s CS community.
