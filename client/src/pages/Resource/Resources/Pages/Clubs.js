                Outside of courses, Cornell offers a variety of ways for
                students to get involved in the local computer science community
                through student computing groups. Joining one or more of these
                organizations is a great way for students to network with other
                computer science students as well as learn about different
                opportunities in the computer science field. These organizations
                also host many company info sessions, academic and career
                development workshops, guest speaker presentations, and other
                events that computer science students may find helpful (not to
                mention, there’s usually free food and swag!).

                <p>
                    The Association of Computer Science Undergraduates, more
                    commonly known as ACSU, is Cornell’s chapter of the
                    Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). ACSU promotes
                    educational, professional, and social interaction among
                    students interested in computer science and facilitates
                    student communication with faculty, alumni, and corporate
                    representatives to enhance the undergraduate experience in
                    computer science. Some things that ACSU oversees include
                    social events for CS students to meet outside of class,
                    student-faculty events, academic workshops to develop
                    technical skills, company information sessions for
                    recruitment, a resume book for internships and full-time
                    employment, student-led reading groups, and a mentorship
                    program.

                    Women in Computing at Cornell, or WICC, is a student
                    organization that seeks to bring together women in computing
                    fields at Cornell, expand their opportunities and successes,
                    provide a support network of women, and empower them to
                    encourage younger women to consider computing fields. WICC
                    membership and events are not just restricted to women, and
                    anyone who is interested is welcome to join. Like ACSU, WICC
                    also oversees many social events, company info sessions,
                    academic workshops, a resume book, and a mentorship program.
                    WICC is an ACM-W Student Chapter.

                <p>
                    Under-Represented Minorities in Computing (URMC) is an
                    undergraduate organization with focus on providing guidance
                    and community for UR minorities interested in majoring in
                    any computing field (CS, InfoSci, ECE, Stats, etc). In spite
                    of being an incredibly diverse school, computing fields at
                    Cornell have a huge representation problem. Engineering CS
                    for example, was only 6% hispanic, and 1% African-American
                    in 2015. URMC aims to provide community, mentorship and
                    career development opportunities specially targeted to URMs,
                    but open to all students in the computing community, to
                    bring minority students together, and provide a welcoming
                    environment to solve this representation gap.

                <h2>Project Teams</h2>
                <p>
                    The College of Engineering has over 20 project teams that
                    allow students of all types of majors to gain hands-on,
                    practical experience in their respective fields. While every
                    project team has a different academic focus, most have some
                    type of software subteam, and computer science students are
                    encouraged to apply to any team that interests them.
                    Computer science fields represented include but are not
                    limited to mobile app development, web development, and
                    software engineering. The general consensus is that
                    students, especially freshmen, shouldn’t be afraid to apply
                    if they have little to no prior experience working on a
                    specific type of project, as many teams tend to accept based
                    on potential and general knowledge of computer science.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Note: Recruitment for project teams generally occurs in the
                    very beginning of the semester (early September for Fall and
                    late January/early February for Spring). Do your research
                    early and don’t miss the application deadlines (some project
                    teams recruit only once a year)!
                    <br /> <br />A few of the more CS-focused project teams are
                    listed below. There are many other teams that have roles
                    relevant to CS majors!

                    ACM is a project team devoted to competitive programming.
                    ACM members participate in several programming competitions
                    per year, including the Google Code Jam, the Facebook Hacker
                    Cup, the Topcoder Open, and the ACM-ICPC. In these
                    competitions, teams must create correct and efficient
                    solutions to problems in a limited amount of time.
                    Participating in these coding challenges can help students
                    to think about their product prior to coding and be able to
                    create a correct solution in all corner cases. Skills
                    developed through ACM competitions can also be very useful
                    for technical interviews.
