                    Science in Computer Science program lasts 4 semesters and
                    requires 34 credits to graduate, 6-12 of those credits
                    dedicated to your thesis research. Itâ€™s required that you
                    work as a TA for each of those semesters. However, you do
                    receive full tuition and a housing stipend while you are in
                    the program. To be accepted into the program, you will need
                    your college transcript, 3 letters of recommendation, a
                    statement of purpose, and an essay describing how a CS MS
                    aligns with your career plans: all of which are due in
                    mid-December.

                    <br />A Ph.D. is a roughly 6-year commitment, which is
                    almost entirely devoted to doing research. Applications are
                    typically due mid-December of your senior year, and
                    typically require 3 recommendation letters, a statement of
                    purpose, transcript, and GRE scores. Unlike undergrad, there
                    is really only one main criterion for admission: whether the
                    university believes that you can excel at doing research.
                    Naturally the best way to demonstrate this is to have
                    undergraduate research experience, which you can read more
                    about in the Research section.
