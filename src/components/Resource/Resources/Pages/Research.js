            Undergraduate research is a unique opportunity to reinforce topics you are learning about in class and to get
            experience working on real world projects. If you think you might want to pursue a PhD after graduating, then
            undergrad research experience is essential.
        </p>
        <h2>Finding a Position</h2>
        <p id='subhead'>
            Finding research opportunities is a fairly painless process once you’ve identified a field you’re interested in.
            Cornell provides a list of faculty members in each field of computer science and a brief description of their work.
            If you find faculty members whose work you find interesting, navigate to their webpages and check out their papers
            to get an overview of the research they do. Send a short (1 - 2 paragraph) email with your resume to these faculty
            members that describes your background and why you’re interested in their work. If all goes well, you’ll be able to
            meet in person to discuss opportunities they have available for you.
        </p>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p id='subhead'>
            It’s always a good idea to try to read the papers written by the faculty member you’re working under, especially
            ones that are related to the work you’ll be doing. You should ask which papers to read and the order in which you
            should read them. These papers will almost certainly be challenging to read since they’re written for an audience of
            experts in the field, but faculty members are usually willing to walk you through the parts that you have trouble
            understanding.
        </p>
        <h2>The Research Experience</h2>
        <p id='subhead'>
            Research is unique from other opportunities available at the undergraduate level in that it is largely self-driven.
            While faculty members will give you a general overview of the project they want you to work on, they don’t have time
            to constantly think of things for you to do. This gives you the freedom to set your own pace, but it also means that
            you’re responsible for the progression of the project.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Credit</h2>
        <p id='subhead'>
            Research can be done either for course credit or (if the research group has sufficient resources) for pay. If you
            opt to take course credit it will appear on your transcript as CS 4999, which can be used to fill a technical
            elective. The CS department website describes the process in more detail here.
