                <p>
                    These classes are required for anyone majoring in computer
                    science. With the exception of CS 2110 and CS 2800 (which
                    are often taken together), it is generally recommended that
                    students should take one core class each semester. However,
                    that isn‚Äôt to say taking more than one (say, CS 4820 and CS
                    3410) is impossible. See the Alternatives to the Core
                    Classes section below for alternate classes, and why you
                    might want to take them instead.

                    content="
                    The first course in the computer science sequence, this is a recommended course to take for all newcomers. It will cover all the necessary skills that every coder has with them, from variables to functions and beyond. Can be waived with AP Computer Science credit (may vary in CAS and CoE departments, however).
                    <br></br>
                    The class is historically taught by Walker White in the fall and then a pair of professors in the Spring. Because the Spring curriculum is based off Professor Walker‚Äôs personally designed Fall curriculum, there shouldn‚Äôt be any major differences in taking it in either semester. Also, because it is an introductory class into the CS world, the class tends to have a large number of consultants whose jobs are also to give advice and insight into the rest of the CS major. There are one-on-one meetings designed into the class for any questions you may have, so make sure to take advantage of those resources if you need them.
                    <br></br>
                    The projects are very straightforward and as long as you‚Äôre paying attention in class/lab and reading instructions carefully, you‚Äôll do well. The most noteworthy project is the last one where you‚Äôll be tasked to create a interactive game.
                    <br></br>
                    Projects can be done in pairs of two or alone. While it might be beneficial to have a partner to talk with, be careful in dividing up work ‚Äì since this is an introductory class, you definitely want to get good grasp of the course material.

                    This class has a lighter amount of work compared to other CS classes. There are seven projects which can be completed with a partner. There are two prelims and an optional final. Grades in homeworks are typically very high (~90) while prelim grades follow a normal distribution (average between 65 and 75). This means that prelims are weighted heavily when deciding grades, so study up.

Although different professors have been teaching it since, the problem sets remain somewhat difficult and much more advanced concepts, such as Turing machines, context-free grammar, computability, and NP-complete problems have been discussed in class in the past year. Prelims have generally been in-class prelims for the past semesters. This last semester, however, prelims were changed to regular evening exams.

                    content="This course introduces you to the paradigm of functional programming in a language called OCaml, which may be quite different from anything you‚Äôve seen until now. The goal of the course is not to just teach you a fancy new programming style but to use it as a tool to help you learn to be better software engineers overall. Topics covered include:

                    Usually the course is a general introduction to functional programming concepts and how they can be applied to real software engineering, but sometimes the course is more mathematical/theoretical, going into depth on topics such as type theory and the constructive real numbers.
                    <br></br>
                    The course consists of three lectures as well as one weekly recitation taught by undergraduate TAs. The recitations are a fantastic resource for not only asking questions and clarifying concepts with peers, but also gaining hands-on experience, as some recitations involve coding. Recitations will not only go in-depth on important topics covered in lecture, but also cover topics more directly related to problem sets.
                    <br></br>
                    This course, like CS 3410, is a significant jump in difficulty/workload from CS 2110, so it would definitely be wise to start projects early and stay on top of the material if you haven‚Äôt gotten into this habit already. There are usually 5-7 projects that consist mostly of programming in OCaml. In the past, the course has varied with regards to working with partners. When it was taught by Constable, for example, it featured mostly individual projects; only one was in pairs. There have also been semesters where all projects were pair or group projects. In Clarkson's offering, the first few projects were individual, and the final project was a group project with 3-4 team members. Historically, this final project allows each group more freedom in their software engineering choices, but also expects much more creativity and ingenuity to come from the assignment.

In terms of the work, you are required to work individually for some of the projects and in a pair for others. The labs are done individually.

                    PA1-3 requires you to make a RISC pipelined-processor through a simulation program called Logisim, which is used to build circuits. You will get familiarized with Logisim through PA1, where you will build an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that performs basic calculations. In PA2 and PA3, you will build a functioning five-stage RISC processor that executes various instructions. PA3 builds on PA2 but is considered to be harder than PA2 since it can be tricky to figure out all the edge cases. PA4 is a friendly hacking challenge which requires you to craft some input to a simplified browser and cause it to print out a different message as its default one. You will essentially be performing a buffer overflow attack on the browser. The last projects, PA5-6, involve writing tests for dynamic memory allocator (malloc) in C and then implementing malloc. A lot of problems arise due to the fact that students are still unfamiliar with common errors found in C.

                    Naturally, this class moves fast since it has to cover materials covered in both ECE 2300 and CS 3420. Reading the book will be a very good supplement. Overall, the materials covered in the class are important to master for any choice of career in CS. The course is also good to know for CS 4410 (Operating Systems), since the material continues approximately where 3410 left off and students use the same tools that you‚Äôve learned here for OS projects.

                    <ul>
                    <li>Synchronization questions involving semaphores and monitors, and race conditions (done in Python)</li>
                    <li>Implementing malloc (done in C) [may change in fall 2017 due to this now being covered in CS 3410]</li>
                    <li>Implementing a given protocol (done in Python)</li>
                    <li>Implementing a part of a file system (has been done in both Python and C before)</li></ul>
                    <br>
                    The projects themselves aren‚Äôt too difficult. The first one will be very helpful for preparing for the first prelim and provide students exposure to synchronization questions. For the rest, try to read over the writeup for the projects very carefully, as even overlooking a minor detail may cost you a significant amount of points, especially as grading for many of the assignments is completely decided by the autograder test cases. Never break the 12 commandments of synchronization!
                    <br></br>
                    Another general advice for the MPs would be to try to sketch out what you will be doing before actually implementing the code. Although this is general advice that can apply to virtually any CS class, this is especially important in OS when you have to, say, implement a protocol that will be designed to respond in a specific manner depending on the context.

                    <br></br>
                    The course has weekly problem sets that usually consists of three problems (two on a short week). Almost all of the problems involve (1) coming up with an algorithm to solve the problem of interest (2) write a proof to explain why the algorithm you proposed solves the problem (3) reason about runtime when applicable. Starting Spring 2016, some problem sets actually included a problem that involved coding in Java.

                    Some helpful advice for the class includes‚Ä¶
                    <ul>
                    <li>the textbook, written by Cornell professors (Eva Tardos and Jon Kleinberg) is super comprehensive and is structured just like the lectures. If you ever had to buy a textbook, this would be the most helpful one in terms of how much it will actually help you with the class</li>
                    <li>even if you plan to put off doing the problem set until a later time, try to read the problems as soon as they are released. Just thinking about the problems in your downtime can save a lot of time when you actually get down to doing it</li>
                    <li>if you haven‚Äôt used LaTeX much up until this point‚Ä¶ be prepared! Sometimes typing up your answers can take longer time than actually doing the problem, so make sure to always leave enough time to type.</li></ul>

                    content="For this class, you and your partner will be graded solely on the 6 projects that you work on throughout the semester. All of the projects are written in C, and each take a considerable amount of time (heavy workload). Each project delves deeper into a topic that was briefly introduced in the lecture, which gives you a deeper understanding of the material. If you take this class, you have to do only the first Mini Project (MP) for OS and can ignore the other ones.
                    <br></br>
                    The projects are estimated to be around 30-40 hours of work, but they are spaced out 2-3 weeks apart. Note that the first 4 projects build on each other. If you have a mistake on project 1, you must fix it before you turn in project 2 or else you will lose points. Or even worse, you will run into a huge error later down the line. More often, significant points are lost on projects by missing a detail that was in the writeup. For this class especially, make sure to check Piazza frequently for updates and clarification on the specifications for the project so that you don‚Äôt lose points for dumb mistakes.
                    <br></br>
                    Most of the difficulty comes from the nuances of working in C and familiarizing yourself with the codebase. If you need C help, go early in the week since office hours have to accommodate both 4410 and 4411 students.
                    <br></br>
                    General tip to score well on projects: even though it may be tedious, try to write a very simple test for each functionality you implemented. While working in C, it is easy to cast to void pointers and lose all type information, so even seemingly correct code can be wrong because of a simple mistake. If you do this, and make sure to cover every part of the project specifications, you will do very well in the class.
                    <br></br>
                    Though hailed as one of the more notorious of practicums, this course provides a very fulfilling experience. It will stress the importance of building and testing concurrently (not building, then testing), as well as trying to cover every possible corner case while trying your best to follow specifications.
                    <br></br>
                    Also for those who are curious, you CAN take CS 4411 as a standalone class, although if that is the case, then you should have taken CS 4410 prior to taking CS 4411."

                    content="This is the honors version of CS 2110. While the two courses cover approximately the same general topics, CS 2112 goes into greater depth with the material and has bigger and more challenging assignments. In particular, in CS 2112 you will learn more about algorithms and algorithm analysis on the theory side and about software design principles on the practical side.
                    <br></br>
                    The main difference from CS 2110, however, is in the projects. The coursework consists of several individual assignments followed by a final project spanning multiple assignments that you will work on with a partner for the remainder of the course. The assignments often involve implementing many of the data structures and algorithms covered in class. The final project also involves working with a partner in designing and managing a large codebase (thousands of lines of code) from scratch. These assignments are far heavier than the ones in CS 2110, so definitely consider the rest of your schedule and commitments before deciding to take this course. If you have the time to devote to this course though, you will learn a lot and also find yourself more equipped for the difficulty of upper-level CS courses.
                    <br></br>
                    While projects from other introductory classes (CS 1110, CS 2110) focus more on getting familiar with the language and the fundamentals of programming, CS 2112 focuses more on object oriented design. Having a good design and working plan goes a long way. Talking to the TA‚Äôs or the professor about your design will drastically reduce your work time. Make sure to devote enough time talking with your partner about design.

                    <li>Start your labs early! It is sometimes very hard to tell whether there is a bug in your code, so you might save yourself a lot of stress by making sure you have ample time to debug. This advice especially applies for the last two labs, which may seem a little rushed due to the proximity of finals season.</li>
                    <li>Try to review the material on a weekly basis to prepare yourself for the once-a-week i>Clicker quiz! This will also help you prepare for the prelims.</li>

                    content="In this course, students are assigned into groups of 6 containing programmers and designers at the very start of the semester, and work within that team to build a fully fledged desktop PC/Mac game that will enter the annual GDIAC Showcase at the end of the semester.
                    <br></br>
                    Lectures for the course cover both design and programming elements of computer game development, and serves as a useful resource for designing and building the game. For the first month while brainstorming game ideas, programmers and designers all must complete a series of 4 labs designed to teach you basic programming or designing techniques. The game is built using Java and the LibGDX framework. Art assets are generally created via Adobe Photoshop.
                    <br></br>
                    After the first month, there will be 7 milestones, with each one typically taking two weeks. The major milestones are: Non-digital Prototype, Gameplay Prototype, Technical Prototype, Alpha Release, Beta Release, Final Release, GDIAC Showcase. For each milestone, you will estimate what you will do for the milestone, demonstrate the milestone‚Äôs work in class or in labs, reflect on whether you met the goals for this milestone, and receive detailed feedback as well as suggestions moving forward from the professor and the TAs.
                    <br></br>
                    This course must also be taken with the 1 credit ENGRC 3152 course. Therefore, there are also document writing throughout the course. For every two week sprint, there will be a two week report. Other documents include the Concept Document, Gameplay Specification, Architecture Specification, Design Specification, and Game Manual. These documents will typically undergo three rounds of revision, where the last version turned in will be the final grade for the documents.
                    <br></br>
                    In the GDIAC Showcase, your game will be presented to the public. This counts at the final exam of the course, and the audience reaction will also be part of your final grade. The audience will be allowed to vote for their favorite, and there will be an award ceremony at the end of the showcase for various awards.
                    <br></br>
                    Because this is a very serious course where approximately 10 hours of work per person per week is expected, (and is a very competitive course to get in) there is an application handed in to professor Walker White that will determine whether you can get into the course, as well as your team assignment.

                    <ul>
                    <li>Team dynamics is really important. Communicate often and resolve conflicts as soon as possible. Know your teammates strengths and weaknesses so as to balance work amongst yourselves.</li>
                    <li>Take the labs seriously and use them as a guideline to learn. A lot of the programming part is based heavily on some of the labs, and you are free to use any lab code. Knowing the labs well will make your lives easier when developing the game. For designers, the labs are great tutorials to help you get familiar with photoshop (if you are not already so) on digital art and animation.</li>
                    <li>Learn to use git well. Merge conflicts on the morning of a demo day is a very bad idea.</li></ul>

                    This course covers mathematics relevant to upper-division computer science courses in machine learning, numerical analysis, graphics, vision, robotics, etc. The major topics are [numerical] linear algebra, statistics, and optimization. There is no required textbook; Damle provides a long list of resources (books, other lectures, etc.) you can reference if you would like.
                    <br></br>
                    Grading is based on participation, homework assignments, exams, and a final project. Homework assignments consist of both mathematical questions (including proofs) and programming (i.e. implementing algorithms taught in lecture), and you do get some slip days. The final project was open-ended; the goal was basically to demonstrate what you learned over the course and explore some kind of application for [a] concept[s] in the form of a project and accompanying paper. Exams were take-home, and lasted 4-ish days; they were open everything (you could even look at sources on the Internet, as long as you cited them) and also very hard.

                    content="In this course, students are divided into interdisciplinary teams of six students, comprised of both programmers and designers. Team members must work together throughout the semester to build a fully-fledged cross-platform mobile game that will enter the annual GDIAC Showcase. Devices are useful but not required; some students may be interested in purchasing a cheap Android phone or iPod touch for development purposes.
                    <br></br>
                    Lectures for the course cover both design and programming as applied to computer game development. There are no labs. Games are built using C++ and Cocos2d-x, while art assets are generally created via Adobe Photoshop.
                    <br></br>
                    The semester is split into several milestones, with each one typically taking two weeks. These include various prototypes (Non-digital, Gameplay, Technical) and releases (Alpha, Closed Beta, Open Beta, Showcase). Each milestone requires careful planning and sizing; at sprint‚Äôs end, teams can expect to receive detailed feedback from the course staff and an opportunity for self-evaluation.
                    <br></br>
                    This course must also be taken with the 1-credit ENGRC 4152. Therefore, document writing is an integral part of the class; for every two-week sprint, there will also be a two-week report. Other assigned documents include the Concept Document, Gameplay Specification, Architecture Specification, Design Specification, and App Store Proposal. These documents will typically undergo several rounds of revision, in which the last version turned in will earn the final grade for the document.
                    <br></br>
                    In the GDIAC Showcase, your game will be presented to the public. This counts as the final exam for the course, with audience reception factored into a game‚Äôs final grade. GDIAC attendees vote for their favorite games, and awards in various categories are distributed at the end of the Showcase.
                    <br></br>
                    Because this is an intensive course where approximately 10 hours of work per-person per-week are expected, prospective students must apply and be approved by Professor Walker White before enrolling. Applications are also used as the basis for team assignments, which are made by Professor White.

Groups typically consist of 1 or 2 designers, and 4 programmers.
                    <br></br>
                    Lectures combine basic elements of game design with topics on data gathering for games. Game design topics taught include learnability and user interfaces, procedural content generation, balancing, and level design. Students will also learn how to collect data and make conclusions based on it to improve their game.
                    <br></br>
                    The games are typically written in Flash/HTML5, and have in the past always been 2D games. There are five milestones in total, spaced out approximately every 1.5 weeks. The last two milestones are public, and consist of releasing to Newgrounds and Kongregate respectively. Most games will receive at least 1,000 views.
                    <br></br>
                    After each milestone, groups present to the class on the data they gathered, as well as any conclusions they drew from this data. For example, a group may notice a steep dropoff in the number of players that pass a certain level, and talk about why this might be the case and how they can fix it. In at least one milestone, students must also perform an A/B test on a release of their games.
                    <br></br>
                    Students who are interested should expect to spend at least 10 hours a week on this class. In addition, students will need to meet with their group often - the most successful games in this class are built by groups that communicate and work together effectively.

                    This class is sometimes compared with CS-3152/4152; its format draws influence from these classes. Games in the analytics-driven class are slightly smaller in scope than those of the other game design courses, due to the emphasis on iterating on gameplay through analytics. In addition, lectures in this class overlap slightly with CS-3152, though most lectures are specific to this class. The class format is also fairly similar, with some class periods reserved for playtesting.
                    <br></br>
                    Previous game design experience is recommended, but not required, for both programmers and designers. In addition to the prerequisites listed below, some knowledge of MySQL for programmers is also helpful but not required. Designers should have some art and animation experience.
                    <br></br>

                    Lecture attendance is not ‚Äúrequired‚Äù (as attendance is not generally taken, although the professor does take note of who asks/answers questions (for participation credit)), but is generally recommended, for two major reasons: 1) The professor does not have nor post slides/recordings, his philosophy being that you should be coming to class and actively note-taking, and 2) There are occasionally in-class quizzes/activities that will not be announced in advance.
                    <br></br>
                    Homework assignments were generally manageable conceptually but could get time-consuming. They were all or almost all programming; difficulties tend to be in debugging or improving efficiency (reducing runtime) rather than in understanding/executing the actual algorithms.
                    <br></br>
                    The final project is to create an app/website (in a team of 4 or 5) which takes in some ad hoc user inputs (text, keywords/tags, slider values, etc.) and then outputs some result which is generated from some kind of relevance computation and machine learning. It spans many weeks, with clear milestones that you have to submit along the way, including a proposal, versions of your application, and short (<5 minutes) presentations to the class. You also get assigned a TA to guide you and consult regarding your choices/goals. It is not hard to do, but does take time (depending on how your team works and what experience you have going in). 
                    <br></br>
                    Exams were in-class; they were not difficult except for that the time provided is notably short; you are more likely to run out of time than not know the answers. You also get one sheet of notes.

                    Some advice...
                    <ul>
                    <li>For the final project, diversify your team‚Äôs backgrounds. The appearance of your application can be made passable with just HTML, CSS, and Jinja (or similar), but you can achieve a much more elegant final product if someone has experience with React, for example. The actual computational code will likely be done in Python. You also will likely have to do web scraping of some kind. Learning these things as you go is manageable, though. (You can pretty easily find past projects public on GitHub which you can use for reference if you find yourself struggling with the coding.)</li>
                    <li>For the timed exams, keep your eye on the clock! Try to follow the recommended times that they note for each question (they‚Äôll say, for example, 10 minutes recommended for Question 4). Do not get carried away doing one problem extremely neatly and in depth. (You won‚Äôt necessarily benefit from having a super detailed cheatsheet. Since time is more likely to be an issue than knowledge/comprehension, focus more on making sure formulas/topics are clear and quick to refer to, so you don‚Äôt waste time searching or trying to make out what you wrote.)</li>

                    content="This course gives an introduction to the field of generating images using computers and provides a foundation for pursuing more advanced and specific areas like animated films and video games. The course starts with the basic building blocks of representing a three-dimensional scene, including object meshes, perspective, lighting, and transformations in space, and then goes on to rendering techniques like ray tracing and rasterization through the graphics pipeline. Finally, subjects such as curves, textures, animation, and other advanced topics are covered. The course involves a decent amount of mathematics, including mostly linear algebra with a little bit of calculus, and prior knowledge is not a prerequisite but of course would be helpful.
                    <br></br>
                    There are generally around 7 projects (under Professor Bala), covering object meshes, basic ray tracing, scene rendering, shaders in GLSL, splines, animation, and advanced ray tracing. Projects consist of a programming part (done with a partner) and a written part (done alone). The written parts are usually a few questions designed to reinforce the theory taught in class. Programming assignments are done in Java and come with skeleton code as well as the course-created Java graphics framework. These are straightforward for the most part, as most of it is just translating the procedures or mathematics they describe into code. However, it is easy to make minor mistakes that are often very difficult to debug due to the nature of the subject, as you generally have few references other than the generated image to troubleshoot the problem, so it is important to be careful when programming and to really understand the theory before tackling the implementation. The course Java framework, although constantly being improved by the TAs, can also be buggy at times or counterintuitive if you're not careful, so read the specs carefully. Programming assignments are graded in scheduled demo sessions and are evaluated mostly visually based on the end result rather than through automated test cases.
                    <br></br>
                    There is also a midterm and a final, which along with the programming and written assignments encompass graded material in the course.

                    The assignments focus on writing shaders, which are special programs that allow you to manipulate the way objects are drawn. This extra experience can be very useful if you want to pursue graphics further in practical applications, since shaders are an essential part of the GPU rendering pipeline used to render most scenes.

                    This course covers a breadth of subjects about digital images starting from the level of an unfamiliar beginner and then builds up to more complex techniques. Students first learn about how an image is made up (image representation, filtering, fourier analysis) and then dive into the fundamental theories and techniques used in the field (feature detection, image transformations, single view modeling, stereo view modeling, structure from motion), and finally it finishes off with a strong focus in deep neural networks (Convnets, object recognition, face recognition, scene categorization), which have recently become more dominant in the field.

                    This is a project-based course, with students expected to complete roughly 5-6 projects and 2-3 homeworks over the course of the semester.

                    The 4 homework assignments are assigned a bit sporadically, but always cover the material after the last assignment. You also tend to get a handful of late-day extensions for turning in homeworks. These assignments are nontrivial for the most part, and cover much of the material that will be tested during the exams. There are two exams: the midterm and the final, which account for the bulk of your grade, and feature questions similar to those you‚Äôve seen in the homeworks. In the past, class participation (questions/answers and comments during class) was also included as a mandatory part of your grade, but was changed to an optional extra-credit in Fall 2016 due to the size of the class.

                    <b>‚è∞ Workload:</b> One homework every week - usually 5 questions. In fall 2017, there were a total of 12 homeworks. Usually homeworks can be done pretty quickly if you‚Äôve already gone to lectures and understand the material. Very often questions will come straight from lectures. Other times, they come from the textbook."

                    title="CS 4830: Introduction to Cryptography"
                    content="An introductory course to cryptography. This course covers both the theory and application sides of cryptography. On the theory side, beginning with a formal definition of security, it goes on to cover computational indistinguishability, numerous methods of message encryption, digital signatures, and finally various consensus protocols. On the application side, topics include oblivious RAM and garbled circuits, which are fascinating ideas proposed only during the last few decades.
                    <br></br>
                    There is one written homework assignment that emphasizes rigorous proofs based on a solid understanding of definitions and concepts covered in class. Besides, there are also two coding projects, for which you will use Java to implement two interesting applications of cryptography and then run large-scale performance tests to reason about their security. Besides, there are two take-home prelims and one final.
                    <br></br>
                    The professor usually starts the class with a 5-minute quiz on the material of the previous lecture and takes attendance in this way.

                    <b>üìÖ Offered:</b> Every Spring before 2018
                    <br>
                    <b>‚úÖ Prerequisite:</b> CS 2800, as the class assumes knowledge of number theory, probability theory and proof techniques.
                    <br>
                    <b>‚è∞ Workload:</b> Medium. In spring 2017, there was one long written homework and two coding assignments. The proofs in the written homework are reasonably hard, but the coding assignments are fairly simple once you‚Äôve understood the key ideas behind the application."
